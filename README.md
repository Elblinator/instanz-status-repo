# instanz-status-repo

This program is supposed to display different instances and the status (offline, online, slow, error) of their services.

Instances can be presented as:
 - running (online, slow, error) vs stopped (offline) (still to be implemented)

 If one Instance is selected every service and their status can be seen.
