# Components: 
 - search field needs to be linked with different pages
 - I want a button with just the display of one colour
 - functional Login/Logout Button
 - Status-Update-Page is not optimal atm: if possible the 4 Arrays should become one array([1,2,3,4])->.ty, repeatitive code -> html
 - how selected Status and Instanz have to be displayed needs to be decided

# Design:
 - numbers in start need to be bar with colour 
 - placement of everything (buttons, titles, etc.) needs correction
 - appearance needs to be adusted to OpenSlides
 - I want a little OpenSlides-Logo


 ## Additional Thoughts:
 - messages not needed atm, delete if not needed
 - dashboard not needed atm, delete if not needed
 - old-status not needed , delete if that stays the same

 # No to forget:
 - if real data is used use url in status.service.ts getData()
