## Questions: 
- how can I reach my database without copying it?
- why is the token not working?
- one step before decode Token (bc the tests are indeed not all working) -> but I have also switched user.id to user.name, bc I do not know how to create an individuel uniwue id, ugh.
- User() ingeneral is probably the problem right now
